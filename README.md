# MNIST Digit Classifier

This is my first neural network project using TensorFlow and Keras.  
The model learns to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## What I Learned

- Basics of neural networks (layers, neurons, activation functions)
- How to train and evaluate a model with Keras
- Data normalization and model accuracy evaluation

## Model Architecture

- Flatten layer (input shape: 28x28)
- Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation
- Output layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation

## Results

After 5 epochs, the model achieves around 98% accuracy on the test set.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is included in `keras.datasets`.

## Source

This project is based on a tutorial from YouTube (Codebasics).  
I followed the tutorial to understand the core concepts and wrote the code in Jupyter Notebook.

## Next Steps

- improving my knowledge
- building the project as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
